                                    <p>Prior to Gruntwork, I founded <a href="http://phoenixdevops.com">Phoenix DevOps</a> as an AWS consulting company where I helped both startups and Fortune 100 companies implement AWS best practices. During that time, I wrote <a href="https://www.airpair.com/aws/posts/building-a-scalable-web-app-on-amazon-web-services-p1">A Comprehensive Guide to Building a Scalable App on Amazon Web Services</a>, a 12,000-word guide which has received over 1,000,000 views since its publication.</p>

                                    <p>Prior to Phoenix DevOps, I founded Omedix (now <a href="https://www.edaris.com/">Edaris Health</a>), a patient engagement company that at its peak served over 4,200 providers and 500,000 patient-users, and collected over $20 million in patient payments.</p>
                                    <p>This was the first company I founded and there were some wins, but also many lessons learned. Truthfully, the team did not execute well on our software, which led to missed business opportunities and a profound sense of frustration. This ultimately drove me to intensively self-educate on what it takes to write software effectively.</p>
