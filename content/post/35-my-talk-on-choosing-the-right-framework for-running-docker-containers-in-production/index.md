I spoke today at [Iterate.PHX](http://www.iteratephx.co/), a DevOps conference put on right here in Phoenix, AZ.

My topic was on choosing the right framework for running docker containers in production. I specifically focus on the “multi-container VM” paradigm since if you’re OK to just run a single container per VM, then you don’t really need a framework at all. In that case, Docker is really just your deployment artifact.

The slides are below, and if there’s a video of the talk I’ll add that here as well. Enjoy!
