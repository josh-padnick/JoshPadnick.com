I recently gave a talk at Desert Code Camp 2013.2 on an introduction to [Play Framework](http://playframework.com/). I’m just getting started with it, but there are several concepts that got me interested:

* Non-blocking / Evented vs. Threaded
* Command-line interface to compile, test, and more
* Clearly inspired by the productivity Ruby on Rails, but written for Java
* Written using a Functional Programming paradigm
* Super-easy for creating RESTful web services
The devil’s always in the details, of course, but it’s been a blast so far! More to come on Play…
