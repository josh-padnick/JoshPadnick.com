This article was posted two years ago, but it’s still a pretty cool concept.  Basically, Zappos (the online shoe site that Amazon recently bought) will train new hires for 4 weeks, and then offers them $3,000 to quit.  [Check it out for yourself:](http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/sep2008/sb20080916_288698.htm)

I feel these kinds of counterintuitive moves have a deeper wisdom in them.  Conventional wisdom says “why would ever induce someone who we just spent 4 weeks training to quit?”  A more zen approach says “we only want to work with people who really want to work with us, and we believe if they take ‘the offer’ we all saved ourselves the heartache of what would have been inevitable.”

The offer above isn’t perfect and does have its drawbacks, but it’s certainly a concept worth pondering.
