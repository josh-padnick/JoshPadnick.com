I gave two presentations at [Desert Code Camp 2014.2](http://oct2014.desertcodecamp.com/home) earlier today. The first was an intro to EmberJS.

Ember is known for its steep initial learning curve and it was an interesting challenge trying to pack in so many concepts in 60 minutes. I had a great time preparing for, and giving the talk.
