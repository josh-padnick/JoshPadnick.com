      <title>The Best Tour Guide I’ve Ever Had</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2017/11/the-best-tour-guide-ive-ever-had/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, my family and I went to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nps.gov/cagr/index.htm&#34;&gt;Casa Grande Ruins National Monument&lt;/a&gt; in Coolidge, Arizona. Coolidge is a pretty small town — less than 12,000 people in total. And it’s at least an hour away from any major city in Arizona. Also, this is hardly the most famous monument in Arizona, so suffice it to say we weren’t expecting too much. Really, it was just a fun random road trip on a holiday weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as we finished eating our lunch at the picnic tables, the park announced that a new guided tour was starting in 5 minutes. That sounded like a good idea so we decided to join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What followed was a vivid and dare I say gripping exposition on Hohokam culture some thousand years ago. Against the backdrop of what we later learned was a major architectural structure in a major city in a culture that has long since collapsed, this turned out to be a surprisingly engaging tour.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Best Way to Buy a New Car</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2017/04/the-best-way-to-buy-a-new-car/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2017/04/the-best-way-to-buy-a-new-car/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently bought a new car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first car purchase in 8 years, and being the obsessive geek that I am, I researched every last detail of the optimal process for buying a new car. By optimal I basically mean “get exactly the car you want for the lowest possible price.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I put in all the time to do the research, I figured I’d share everything I learned in the hopes that it helps someone out if they’re ready to buy a new car. That, and my Dad asked me for details, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to cut right to the chase, I wound up saving over $3,500 from the original price I was quoted (which included a trade-in of a 2008 BMW 328i Coupe). I won’t bother mentioning the specific car I bought because it’s not relevant to this post, but its MSRP was around $30,000.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Proposal for a new type of media source: &#34;True News&#34;</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2016/11/a-proposal-for-a-new-type-of-media-source-true-news/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Nov 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The November 2016 election has made me think about democracy, government, and our society in new ways for the first time in my life. One topic that seems to keep coming up is this idea of truth in the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think most people would say they’d rather read news they know to be true than live in a fantasy world where they read news they like but which they know to be false. It’s basically an alternate take on the famous thought experiment, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_machine&#34;&gt;Experience Machine&lt;/a&gt;, and comes to the same conclusion: truth matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, truth may be the single-most important attribute of the news we read. And if you really start to think about it, truth becomes a really slippery concept.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Democracy 1.0</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2016/11/democracy-1.0/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2016/11/democracy-1.0/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whoever you voted for in the recent election, most people agree it was one of the most negative elections in their lifetime. People on both sides of the ballot used words like “disgusted”, “exhausted”, and “embittered” to describe their state of mind come November 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The candidate who won the electoral college lost the national popular vote. Hundreds of thousands of people have come out to protest that the winner is “not my president.” As a result of the election, virtually all levels of government will be controlled by Republicans, yet Democrats represent roughly 50% of the electorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if that’s not enough, people’s trust in the media and the factual accuracy of the information they read is at an all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me Democracy 1.0 ain’t working out so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, most Americans call the American system of government “democracy”, but even that term is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy#Types_of_democracies&#34;&gt;loaded with nuance&lt;/a&gt;. Technically, the USA is a “federal presidential constitutional republic,” owing to the fact that it is a federation of states, that the people elect a president in a fair and free election, that the rights of all citizens are guaranteed by a founding constitution, and that the people do not directly vote on government matters (usually considered impractical), but rather elect representatives who do that for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of this blog post, I’ll just use the term “democracy 1.0” to mean all the above since it’s simpler and more in line with how people use the term in everyday conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is democracy 1.0 failing us? I think it is in some profound and interesting ways, and the point of writing this post is to explore how.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thoughts from Ireland</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2016/10/thoughts-from-ireland/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2016/10/thoughts-from-ireland/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past week I had the pleasure of visiting my &lt;a href=&#34;http://ybrikman.com/?ref=joshpadnick.com/ireland&#34;&gt;esteemed Gruntwork co-founder&lt;/a&gt; where he currently lives in Dublin, Ireland. I had a blast, it was awesome to work in person with Jim, and it was the first time I’ve been to Europe in about 15 years!








&lt;figure style=&#34;padding: 0.25rem; margin: 2rem 0;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&#34;max-width: 100%; height: auto;&#34; src=&#34;https://JoshPadnick.com/2016/10/thoughts-from-ireland/images/IMG_4449-1_hu3f80a5f7f6071aee81537d9ffa5d636d_555535_400x500_fit_box_2.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; height=&#34;300&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;small&gt;
            
            Sort of looks like Jim and I are opening a pizzeria together.
            
        &lt;/small&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, Irish culture and American culture aren’t much different. We both speak English as our primary language, we both eventually left the rule of the UK, and much of Ireland feels like a typical Western country. But there are some really interesting differences, too, and to make sure I don’t forget them, here they are!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Talk on New AWS Services</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2016/09/my-talk-on-new-aws-services/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Sep 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2016/09/my-talk-on-new-aws-services/</guid>
      <description>I recently gave a talk to the AWS Phoenix Meetup on three new services and updates from AWS: the Application Load Balancer (ALB), EC2 Container Service (ECS), and Kinesis Analytics.
More than half the software teams I meet today run Docker in production, so there was high interest in how you can use the ALB with an ECS cluster to have a more streamlined docker cluster setup.
Some important details I since learned that are worth mentioning:
 The ALB’s costs scale with use. For example, if you have 1,000,000 idle web socket connections, you’ll pay $2,000/month! But presumably if you have 1,000,000 active users that kind of cost is ok. Thanks to nivertech on Hacker News for pointing this out. The ALB currently has a bug that impacts its ability to do zero-downtime deployments. Special credit to my colleague Yevgeniy Brikman for discovering and reporting this!  Check out the presentation on the Gruntwork Blog!</description>

      <title>My Thoughts from DockerCon 2016</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2016/06/my-thoughts-from-dockercon-2016/</link>

      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2016/06/my-thoughts-from-dockercon-2016/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished attending &lt;a href=&#34;http://2016.dockercon.com/&#34;&gt;DockerCon 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and overall it was a pretty useful conference! I like to summarize what I learned both for my own mental clarity, and so others can benefit. So here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Many Different Ways Can You Deploy a Production Container Cluster?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Docker as a format for deploying things, but oh my gosh, how many different options are there for deploying it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for “Heroku for Containers”, Docker has a pretty nice offering called Docker Cloud that seems really good. But once you’re ready to manage your own infrastructure, well, there was a long list to consider.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing Gruntwork</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2016/05/introducing-gruntwork/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2016 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2016/05/introducing-gruntwork/</guid>
      <description>In November 2014, I started helping software teams ramp up on Amazon Web Services and DevOps. This was gratifying work because a few years prior, I was involved in a project that did a terrible job of DevOps and suffered greatly for it. Now I was helping other teams avoid that same fate.
And what an adventure it turned out to be! I got the chance to work with Intel, Infusionsoft, 3-person startups, a well-funded Spotify competitor and so many other interesting companies doing interesting things. I called the consulting practice Phoenix DevOps because, well, I live in Phoenix, Arizona, and it turns out the concept of immutability (sometimes known as “Phoenix Servers”) is a central tenet of DevOps.
Along the way, I wrote A Comprehensive Guide to Building Scalable Web Apps on AWS, Part 1, and gave lots of DevOps presentations at various meetups and conferences.
During that time I also discovered the outstanding Blog of Yevgeniy Brikman (“Jim”). Jim mentioned one day he was looking for DevOps people and I loved his work, so I messaged him: “Hey, I do DevOps for lots of teams and have no time right now but let’s talk!”
It turned out Jim was doing consulting very similar to what I was doing through his own consulting practice, Atomic Squirrel. And after many conversations and trial projects, we decided we really liked working with each other.
As we compared all our experiences, we realized we’d basically been doing the same thing for every client. Setup a best-practices VPC, automate deployment, setup monitoring/metrics, get ramped up on AWS, etc.
Doing consulting on an hourly basis was one paradigm for helping clients solve these problems, but what if we could solve the problems really well one time and then consult with clients merely to help them adopt what was already built? That would mean we could significantly lower the cost and time needed to get your DevOps on.
Well, that’s what we’ve decided to do! And so today, it is my pleasure to announce that I am officially winding down Phoenix DevOps and joining with Yevgeniy Brikman in a new company we call Gruntwork.
Why call it Gruntwork? Because that’s what this work is for almost every software team. Whatever app you want to build, the infrastructure stands between your vision and your app; almost no one gets excited about automating their infrastructure. Not to mention that it’s hard to find DevOps engineers, they’re often expensive, and they hold all the keys to your kingdom. And when they leave, then what?
So Gruntwork is here to do your grunt work for you, and because of the way we’ve set things up, and the thousands of hours of collective experience we have, we can help you achieve a result that’s more effective and less expensive than the most amazing DevOps person you could hire.
One other aspect of Gruntwork that’s important to Jim and me is that Gruntwork has to be able to completely disappear and you should still be ok to run your infrastructure. Would I base my important project’s entire infrastructure on a new company that was just started by a couple of guys? Only if I had complete control of the source code and could run it without them.
So, unlike most businesses which strive to build lock-in to your product, we are actively striving to build “not lock-in”. It’s actually kind of hard to do sometimes, but it means that customers can choose to come back to us not because the cost of switching is so painful but because we continue to actively provide them value.
There’s more to share in the Gruntwork story, but I think that’s enough for now and we’ll announce more when we’re ready. In the meantime, I am thrilled to be working with Jim, who’s been a fantastic business partner so far, and I am thrilled to embark on this new adventure!
Thanks for reading. Now time to get some Gruntwork done…</description>

      <title>Play Framework &#43; Docker &#43; CircleCI &#43; AWS &#43; EC2 Container Service</title>

      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2015/11/play-framework-docker-circleci-aws-ec2-container-service/</guid>
      <description>I was invited to speak earlier tonight at the Phoenix Java User’s Group on Play Framework, DevOps, and AWS.
I decided to do a basic walkthrough of Play Framework, and to build a continuous deployment pipeline live as part of the presentation. I wanted to actually implement something so that (a) I would be forced to pick specific technologies I could talk about, and (b) I could talk about the real-world challenges of implementing something.
I created 4 public GitHub repos to implement this:
 https://github.com/PhoenixDevOps/phxjug-ctr-base https://github.com/PhoenixDevOps/phxjug-ctr-base-play https://github.com/PhoenixDevOps/phxjug-play-framework-demo https://github.com/PhoenixDevOps/phxjug-ecs-cluster  Check out slide 36 for some directions on how to use all these items together, although I recognize the overall documentation may not be suitable for beginners since the presentation itself filled in the gaps in the slides. Enjoy!

      <title>My Talk on Choosing the Right Framework for Running Docker Containers in Production</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2015/09/my-talk-on-choosing-the-right-framework-for-running-docker-containers-in-production/</link>

      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2015/09/my-talk-on-choosing-the-right-framework-for-running-docker-containers-in-production/</guid>
      <description>I spoke today at Iterate.PHX, a DevOps conference put on right here in Phoenix, AZ.
My topic was on choosing the right framework for running docker containers in production. I specifically focus on the “multi-container VM” paradigm since if you’re OK to just run a single container per VM, then you don’t really need a framework at all. In that case, Docker is really just your deployment artifact.
The slides are below, and if there’s a video of the talk I’ll add that here as well. Enjoy!

      <title>A Common Pattern in Successful Companies</title>

      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2015/06/a-common-pattern-in-successful-companies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been helping software teams accelerate and succeed with DevOps and Amazon Web Services for a few months now (See &lt;a href=&#34;http://phoenixdevops.com/&#34;&gt;Phoenix DevOps&lt;/a&gt;), and one of the more rewarding parts of the job is getting to observe how multiple different companies operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen high-performing teams in companies that are about to IPO, software teams in Fortune 100 companies, startups of about 10 engineers, and software-based companies of no engineers at all! It’s been incredibly enlightening for me to learn about how people organize themselves to get sh*t done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Simple Tool for Snapshotting Your EC2 Instances</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2015/06/a-simple-tool-for-snapshotting-your-ec2-instances/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2015 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2015/06/a-simple-tool-for-snapshotting-your-ec2-instances/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a simple tool that makes it easy to create an AMI of your EC2 instance, and then to delete all AMI’s older than X days/hours/minutes with a single command. Check it out at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/josh-padnick/ec2-snapper&#34;&gt;https://github.com/josh-padnick/ec2-snapper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works especially well for backing up WordPress blogs hosted on a single instance in AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to do backups in AWS. One of them is creating an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) of your EC2 Instance so that you have a moment-in-time backup which you can use to launch a new EC2 instance in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not the world’s most robust backup method. First, in order to guarantee that your file system is consistent at the moment of your snapshot, you have to agree to reboot your instance. Second, if you’re backing up data where even a few minutes of data loss is a big deal, this solution isn’t for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes it’s actually the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2015/03/a-comprehensive-guide-to-scaling-web-mobile-apps-on-aws-part-1/</guid>
      <description>I published a 12,000+ word guide in January on AirPair.com on building scalable apps on Amazon Web Services. I’ve been a longtime Hacker News reader so it was gratifying to see the article get 500+ upvotes on Hacker News! It also attracted about 30,000 readers in the first 24 hours of publication.
Part 2 of the article is brewing right now, mostly in the form of gaining the real-world experience necessary to write a thorough and helpful guide.
Read the Article on AirPair.com
Update/December 25, 2016 : AirPair.com has been down for a few days now, so if you’d like a copy of the article just email me and I’ll send you a PDF.
Regarding Part 2, I have all the knowledge and experience to write it, but I’ve been busy getting our new “DevOps as a Service” company Gruntwork up and running. I’d like to make it a Q1-2017 goal to publish Part 2, and will report back here once I’ve formally committed to that. Thank you for all your interest!
Update/January 6, 2017: Looks like AirPair is back online, so you can view the article there now!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend, I volunteered at a clinic in Puerto Peñasco, Mexico (better known to Americans as “Rocky Point”).  The clinic was makeshift, conducted in a church in a local neighborhood.  It was completely free to the residents and funded with donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surrounding residents would be considered low income by American standards, but I sat on many pre-visit interviews with them and most of them don’t think of themselves as struggling.  They’re really just living their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locals have differences in their lives that I simply haven’t experienced.  In my makeshift Spanish, I learned that one woman, Guadalupe, had been waiting at the free clinic for about 8 hours, not knowing when she would be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What I Learned Teaching Programming to 14-Year Olds</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I volunteered at &lt;a href=&#34;https://codeday.org/phoenix&#34;&gt;CodeDay Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; as a mentor.  The goal of the event was to take young kids (mostly middle school and early high school) and give them an opportunity to code something in 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a mentor, my job was to “walk around and help where I could.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first group I walked up to was creating a tool to help you come up with something to do for the day.  The idea was that it would take your current location, your preference on whether you wanted to eat, play, build, or socialize for that day, look up some locations in a local database and then make a suggested schedule. It was actually kind of a cool concept!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>My second presentation at Desert Code Camp 2014.2 was on Amazon Web Services.
It was exciting to see standing room only during the talk! My main concern was keeping it interesting. The natural temptation for this kind of presentation is to do a “documentation summary” but that risks afflicting the audience with severe boredom. So I used a lot of visuals and everyday analogies in explaining AWS.
I spoke both about the big picture, and then went into detail on two of the most popular AWS services, EC2 and S3. I also briefly described VPC, IAM, RDS, DynamoDB, Glacier, and SES. I received numerous positive comments on the talk, so I’m pleased post the slides below.

      <title>Introduction to EmberJS</title>

      <description>I gave two presentations at Desert Code Camp 2014.2 earlier today. The first was an intro to EmberJS.
Ember is known for its steep initial learning curve and it was an interesting challenge trying to pack in so many concepts in 60 minutes. I had a great time preparing for, and giving the talk.

      <title>Doing Business in The Right Order</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2014/10/doing-business-in-the-right-order/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I celebrated my 10th year at &lt;a href=&#34;http://omedix.com/&#34;&gt;Omedix&lt;/a&gt;, the company I started when I was 24 years old.  At 34, it is a little hard to imagine I’ve done anything for 10 years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The milestone has made me reflect on some of the early decisions I made when I first got started.  There were many really good decisions, but there were plenty of bad ones, too.  And of course when you’re in your early 20’s you have that perfect combination of extreme confidence and supreme ignorance.  Sometimes that can be a good thing, and sometimes it can be as bad as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ally Bank. I Hardly Knew Ye.</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2014/09/ally-bank.-i-hardly-knew-ye./</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2014/09/ally-bank.-i-hardly-knew-ye./</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my review of my first couple of weeks with Ally Bank, and why I ultimately decided to stay with stodgy, old Chase.&lt;/p&gt;









&lt;figure style=&#34;padding: 0.25rem; margin: 2rem 0;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img style=&#34;max-width: 100%; height: auto;&#34; src=&#34;https://JoshPadnick.com/2014/09/ally-bank.-i-hardly-knew-ye./images/ALLY_Bank_withRegistration_hu951708bdb2349ed215365de7a1437f71_7344_400x500_fit_q75_box.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;123&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;small&gt;
            
        &lt;/small&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 16 years old, I went with my Mom to a local Bank One branch to open my own personal checking account. Bank One eventually got acquired by Chase, and so I’ve effectively been a Chase customer for more than half my life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s been a love-hate relationship. On the positive side, it seems that no matter where in the United States I am, I’m always less than 3 miles from a Chase branch, so it’s definitely convenient. I also don’t worry about Chase failing so it seems like a safe place to keep my family’s money. Their iPhone app is actually pretty good, especially the ability to remotely deposit checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on the downside, I often get a “big bank” feel from them, mostly owing to the fact that I don’t really have a personal relationship with anyone there. I find I’m usually just engaging the “Chase Infrastructure” rather than contacting a specific person I know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The User Interface of the Violin</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2014/08/the-user-interface-of-the-violin/</link>

      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2014/08/the-user-interface-of-the-violin/</guid>
      <description>Earlier today, I met a friend for breakfast who’s an outstanding professional UX designer. I was curious about something:
“How do you balance the need to give people a user interface they’re familiar with and can do something with right away, against the opportunity to innovate and do new things that may take more time to learn?”
He gave a beautiful analogy in response.
     “Consider the violin. It has one of the most difficult user interfaces in the world to use. But if you’re willing to put in the thousands of hours of practice, you can make such beautiful music with it. There has to be that trade off. If we demand of our users a steep learning curve, they had better be able to produce some beautiful music.”
I like that idea because I’ve met many designers who get so mesmerized by the idea of doing something new and amazing that they lose sight of the fact that “the tradeoff” has to make sense.</description>

      <title>My Desert Code Camp Presentation on Server Configuration Management with Chef</title>

      <description>I gave this talk at Desert Code Camp earlier today as part of the DevOps track. It gives an introduction to Chef with a special emphasis on getting you to Hello World and beyond.
They say Chef has a steep learning curve, but I think that’s only because there are a lot of concepts you need to know before you can do the most basic things. I tried to cover most of those concepts here. I also included some best practices I discovered such as how to handle secrets like passwords and certificates using Chef.  </description>

      <title>Checks and Balances in Agile Development</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2013/12/checks-and-balances-in-agile-development/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2013 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2013/12/checks-and-balances-in-agile-development/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I worked on a sprint as part of our company’s scrum process.  This sprint was somewhat unusual in that I was the sole developer.  Not only that but I knew most of the specs in my head, so our product manager and I agreed it wasn’t necessary to write acceptance criteria for the user stories I would be working on.  Since I wrote the acceptance criteria, it made sense that I would be the one who ultimately signed off on the user stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate bureaucracy so I was excited about how “lightweight” this process for the sprint was.  But I found something kind of interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was wearing my developer hat, I realized how much I enjoyed taking time to learn about other technologies.  I had made a commitment to my teammates to get a certain amount of work done by a certain date, and we came up with estimates to make sure that the work was achievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once I was doing it, my human nature started subconsciously looking for ways to “cheat”.  I still wanted to get the work done, and done well.  I wanted to be acknowledged by my colleagues for having delivered what was expected with high quality.  But I also wanted to sneak in extra time so I could do more tech learning on the side.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Paying a Medical Bill Should Not Be This Hard</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2013/11/paying-a-medical-bill-should-not-be-this-hard/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2013 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2013/11/paying-a-medical-bill-should-not-be-this-hard/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to paying a medical bill, I’ve had a backwards experience.  As the founder of &lt;a href=&#34;http://omedix.com/&#34;&gt;Omedix&lt;/a&gt;, I built software that’s collected tens of millions of dollars in healthcare bill payments, but I hardly ever paid any healthcare bills of my own.  I was under 30 and hardly went to the doctor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next month I turn 34 and I am fortunate that neither my wife nor I has any chronic medical issues, but now we go to the doctor for the usual annual checkups.  In 2013, our health visits amounted to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annual well-checks with our primary care physician (PCP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lab tests our PCP’s requested&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In her case, annual visit with an OB/GYN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my case, annual check up at the dermatologist (skin doctor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my case, annual check up at the ophthalmologist (eye doctor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m about 4 hours in and almost done paying all the healthcare bills.  The experience has been…traumatizing.  First, multiple bills are sent for the same service, but with slight differences.  Second, our doctor tried to bill insurance, had the wrong info, sent us a bill for the full amount, was later informed the insurance was wrong, adjusted the bill, and sent an updated one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I recently gave a talk at Desert Code Camp 2013.2 on an introduction to Play Framework. I’m just getting started with it, but there are several concepts that got me interested:
 Non-blocking / Evented vs. Threaded Command-line interface to compile, test, and more Clearly inspired by the productivity Ruby on Rails, but written for Java Written using a Functional Programming paradigm Super-easy for creating RESTful web services The devil’s always in the details, of course, but it’s been a blast so far!

      <title>Give, Give, Give, Then Get</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to try an experiment lately.  At every opportunity where I see I can possibly add value to someone in some way, I try to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can mean connecting someone with someone else I know, sharing insights from experiences I’ve had that may be applicable, or even mini-projects that leverage my technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any other behavior change, this is a habit that takes some work to build, so I’m not 100% ramped up yet, but at least the habit is building, so hopefully after a few weeks it will just be my default behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’ve had a few interesting observations about it:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Your New Normal and the Futility of Stress</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2013/06/your-new-normal-and-the-futility-of-stress/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2013 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2013/06/your-new-normal-and-the-futility-of-stress/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a very powerful business experience about 4 years ago that taught me a lesson that I didn’t fully understand until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the sole owner of a company that received a Letter of Intent from a publicly traded company to be acquired for around $1 million, all before I was even 30 years old. Sure sounds sexy, right?  Well, the catch was that we were not profitable at that time and of course the time between receiving a Letter of Intent and actually signing all the contracts, getting a check in the bank, and considering the acquisition a done deal can be anywhere from a few weeks to over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we waited. Doing our best to not be too unprofitable and not incur too many legal expenses, but thrilled at the prospect of an acquisition that would instantly remove all the stress. I remember every day trying to act to the outside world like things were fine, but inside I felt incredibly stressed. Each day was a new opportunity to obsess just a little bit more about when the acquisition would finally close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then finally it did. Except that it didn’t go through, it &lt;em&gt;fell&lt;/em&gt; through.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cutting Out the Noise</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2011/12/cutting-out-the-noise/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2011 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2011/12/cutting-out-the-noise/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I keep noticing a recurring theme in my hobbies and in business: cut out the noise and focus only on the essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems so simple, but the fascinating thing about life is that the things and people we encounter so rarely do cut through the noise.  Instead it seems like most endeavors of consequence are messy, complicated and hard, and it’s not always clear why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you approach almost everything with the mentality of “how do I cut out the noise?” life becomes a very magical experience where a little effort in the right place can yield big results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think can think of at least 3 areas of my own life where cutting out the noise yielded big results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Power of Frames</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2011/10/the-power-of-frames/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2011 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2011/10/the-power-of-frames/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Pitch-Anything-Innovative-Presenting-Persuading/dp/0071752854&#34;&gt;Pitch Anything&lt;/a&gt; by Mr. Oren Klaff and one of the coolest concepts in the book was the idea of “frames.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A frame is basically the set of beliefs, contexts, and assumptions that implicitly sit behind everything you communicate.  The author argues that when two people meet, their frames eventually “clash” and that only one frame can win out.  This concept was also discussed in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Pitch-Anything-Innovative-Presenting-Persuading/dp/0071752854&#34;&gt;The Game&lt;/a&gt; by Neil Strauss, but it was presented there in the context of attracting girls, not clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after I finished reading Pitch Anything, I have been blessed with a special insight into how I and others think, and to the social dynamics underlying most business transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take sales, for example.  When I first started out doing sales, my mentality was always about understanding what the client was saying as precisely as possible and, to the greatest extent possible, providing him with exactly what he requested.  But it turns out that’s not the best way to do business.  Often times, I’ve found, people respect when you challenge them because they see it as an opportunity for growth.  I realized one day that with myself, when someone challenges me head-on, I find them really interesting and then start engaging about why they disagree.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Entrepreneurship Challenge</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2011/06/the-fundamental-entrepreneurship-challenge/</link>

      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2011/06/the-fundamental-entrepreneurship-challenge/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thrashing&lt;/strong&gt; n. To expend a disproportionately high amount of energy relative to the quality of output you receive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was younger and looked at successful companies, I simply could not for the life of me understand how they ever went from NOTHING to what they were today. The modern equivalent would be like asking “How did Jamba Juice launch hundreds of stores across the country? How did that start?” It made sense to me that if you raised a massive amount of money and then immediately bought all the capital equipment and hired all the people you needed then you’d at least be capable of serving all the customers, and that the massive revenue from the customers would balance out your massive expenses…but how did it all come to be from NOTHING? It seemed like magic to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from this line of thought I embarked on what I believe is the fundamental fallacy of entrepreneurial thinking: asking the question “what does a company need to do to succeed?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Technical Founder Strengths and Weaknesses</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2011/04/the-technical-founder-strengths-and-weaknesses/</link>

      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2011/04/the-technical-founder-strengths-and-weaknesses/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are hugely in favor of the technical founder. We will generally focus on companies started by strong technologists who know exactly what they want to build and how they are going to build it.”
– &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen&#34;&gt;Marc Andreessen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always prided myself on being a “technical founder.” Basically, it means that if I were hired as a dedicated software engineer I could make a pretty meaningful contribution to a software product, but that my primary role is to guide the growth of the company as CEO. I used to think that being a technical founder was an absolute advantage over non-technical founders since not only could I do the business thing, but I could really understand at a deep technical level how viable something is, and I also know what’s possible, which enables me to come up with product ideas and visions that non-technical founders might not be able to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But life has this funny thing where our biggest strength can also be our biggest weakness. The trick is being honest with yourself about what they are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lead Like the Great Conductors</title>

      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2011/01/lead-like-the-great-conductors/</guid>
      <description>This is a beautiful exposition (and metaphor) on the role of a leader. I’ve often wondered if it’s better to set forth clear guidelines so that everyone knows exactly what to do, or better to provide people a framework within which to “tell their own story” (to use the words of Mr. Talgam in the video below).
Ultimately, I’ve found that different people respond to different styles. But if there is a “default style,” I believe the conductor who empowers the musicians to perform the music in their own style while providing subtle yet meaningful guidance on context, feeling, and intent produces the most beautiful music.

      <title>Zappos Offers New Hires $3,000 to Quit After 4 Weeks</title>

      <description>This article was posted two years ago, but it’s still a pretty cool concept. Basically, Zappos (the online shoe site that Amazon recently bought) will train new hires for 4 weeks, and then offers them $3,000 to quit. Check it out for yourself.
I feel these kinds of counterintuitive moves have a deeper wisdom in them. Conventional wisdom says “why would ever induce someone who we just spent 4 weeks training to quit?” A more zen approach says “we only want to work with people who really want to work with us, and we believe if they take ‘the offer’ we all saved ourselves the heartache of what would have been inevitable.”
The offer above isn’t perfect and does have its drawbacks, but it’s certainly a concept worth pondering.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When man’s primary job was to find a way to eat each day, distractions were probably not a big deal.  Primitive man had no facebook, no twitter, no IM, no cell phone.  He just had a rumbling in his stomach and the grim realization that either he found some food or he and possibly his family wouldn’t make it past winter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Starbucks Paradox</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2010/11/the-starbucks-paradox/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I would say in the past month I had been going to Starbucks an average of 4 times per week.  One visit of $4.25 is easy enough to swallow, but when I started running the numbers, I was surprised to learn that $4.25 x 4 days per week x 52 weeks per year = are you telling me I spend almost $900/year sipping a latte?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I long ago realized that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/POUR-YOUR-HEART-INTO-STARBUCKS/dp/B0014JVUKU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1289550079&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;value proposition of Starbucks&lt;/a&gt; is much more than just coffee.  Howard Schultz’s original vision was not to “make premium coffee and earn a profit,” but to transport the community-ness of espresso cafes he saw in Italy to the USA, where he felt our society had only grown more isolated over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract as it may be, I think the stores do ultimately deliver on that concept.  I don’t go to Starbucks solely because I like the taste of my drink.  I go with a colleague, we know the baristas, we see people we know, it’s close by, it takes about 15 minutes…and so on.  Basically, it’s just kind of a nice way to take a break!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I needed to cut down the frequency.  So here’s the strange part.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although I love what I do, one of the more frustrating aspects of running a business is that YOU are always the bottleneck for everything. The reason we don’t produce sites faster is because I, personally, have to review them. The reason sales are at X but not Y is because I personally have not yet hired the right salesperson and because I personally am too busy to proactively follow up with every single lead. The reason we haven’t developed our new products faster is because I personally have to do some user interface designs but have been busy with other things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whew, it’s been a long time since I’ve written on this blog.  Nearly 4 months!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I have so many things I’d like to write about, but one thing in particular seems to keep popping up these days: the idea of being honest with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s my nature, maybe it’s my upbringing, but I just really feel uncomfortable when I’m not being forthright with someone.  If I feel like I’m withholding something or not disclosing something it makes me feel manipulative and uneasy.  I feel like I have to just come out with the truth, all of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Connecting with Your True Purpose</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so watch this video for just a little bit before you continue reading:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;youtube&#34; style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/Pb1XXs7e7ac&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things I really love about music is that when we hear great music performed, we aren’t just hearing great music, we’re also hearing an individual who has risen to his or her full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy in the video is of course Bono, U2’s lead singer. The song is “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For.” As you watch Bono singing to thousands of people, you can just tell that Bono has 150% embraced his role. You don’t get the feeling that he’s thinking “Gosh, am I enjoying singing this song? Is this really what I want to be doing with myself?” You can just tell that he is totally congruent with what he’s doing, and is expressing himself to his full potential. Sure enough, thousands of people came out to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paulgraham.com/&#34;&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favorite essayists. He is incredibly smart, but all his essays are written in a totally straightforward style. My latest favorite is about how society is always scheming to help us procrastinate by giving us distractions, and that while we might feel bad spending 2 hours watching soap operas in front of the TV, somehow we don’t feel quite so bad wasting that same time browsing around on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been guilty of this, and it’s something I’m actively working to change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are Great Businesspeople Also “Clever”?</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2008/08/are-great-businesspeople-also-clever/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I thought being a mega-successful entrepreneur like Richard Branson or Michael Dell was a matter of cleverness.  If you were just clever enough to figure out the right market opportunity, then you could make millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How wrong I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Richard Branson.  For his very first entrepreneurial undertaking — when he was still just a teenager — he purchased young Chrismas Trees, planted them during the spring, and then resold them at a profit during Christmas time in the winter.  I actually do think that’s pretty clever, especially for a kid.  But really that’s as far as “clever” alone will take you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I really love about my life is I’ve met more entrepreneurs than I can count. One of the coolest things about entrepreneurs is that they seem to have zero demographics in common. In other words, I’ve met entrepreneurs…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From both wealthy homes and poor homes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of pretty much all ethnic backgrounds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From pretty much all educational backgrounds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of pretty much all ages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In equal proportion from both sexes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of course, as with any group, there are things in common. I guess “traits of an entrepreneur” is destined for another posting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is about a very important difference I’ve seen in all entrepreneurs, and here’s what it comes down to:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Do Entrepreneurs Become Entrepreneurs?</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2006/11/why-do-entrepreneurs-become-entrepreneurs/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2006 15:56:33 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2006/11/why-do-entrepreneurs-become-entrepreneurs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rockstartup.com/&#34;&gt;RockStartup.com&lt;/a&gt;. It’s basically a documentary, split up into several episodes, that covers the birth of the website &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.payperpost.com/&#34;&gt;PayPerPost.com&lt;/a&gt; by following around the CEO/Founder, Ted, and the PR person, Britt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PayPerPost (”PPP”) is a weird concept — PPP pays bloggers to write content and sources content from Publishers, and then earns money by charging advertisers to put ads on PPP-sponsored blog sites. It’s been controversial because blogging’s rise to fame is due to its unbiased nature, and paying someone to blog, well, I guess it’s hard for them not to be biased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the success of PPP is another discussion. I’m more interested in the man behind PPP, Ted. Based on 10 minutes of watching RockStartup, I defnitely saw some “patterns” I’ve seen in other entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was at Wharton as an undergrad, in my Senior year I took an Entrepreneurship course where you had to build some unique software, come up with a business plan, and then pitch it all to VC’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our idea was terrible. We were going to build a system for people running political campaigns to help them get a sense of how people were planning on voting. We had a barcode-scanner-pen that scanned in a person’s survey responses, and then aggregated all the information so that a campaign director could see how people felt about a variety of issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sometimes, Actually Pursuing a Goal is the Worst Way to Achieve It</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a strange phenomenon I’ve discovered in business and in life: I call them “Counter-Goals”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s a Counter-Goal? Well, it’s a goal which is achieved best by not pursuing it in the first place. Huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, an example. When I was in my first year at Wharton Undergrad, I took a class called Management 100. The concept of the course was (and probably still is) quite novel. I was a member of a group of 12 other freshmen, and as a group we were tasked with completing some kind of major project. One group had to build a playground. Another group had to hold a major fundraising event. Our goal happened to be teaching the basics of economics to sixth graders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Strange Lessons in Learning How to Sell Well</title>
      <link>https://JoshPadnick.com/2006/04/strange-lessons-in-learning-how-to-sell-well/</link>

      <guid>https://JoshPadnick.com/2006/04/strange-lessons-in-learning-how-to-sell-well/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve never really thought of myself as a salesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember when I was younger I interned for GE and they had some career fair at the end of the summer where you met people in all the different ‘early talent identification’ programs. When I got to the sales people, they all just seemed so smooth. I didn’t trust them, and I certainly didn’t want to buy anything from them. I just couldn’t picture myself joining that table over some of the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, fast forward a few years after I started &lt;a href=&#34;http://omedix.com&#34;&gt;Omedix&lt;/a&gt; and reality struck – I had inadvertently positioned myself as the sole salesperson for our company. Either I sold our product or we didn’t do business; it was that simple. And so I had to start learning how to sell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
