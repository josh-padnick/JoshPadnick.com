                            <p>I gave this talk at Desert Code Camp earlier today as part of the DevOps track. It gives an introduction to Chef with a special emphasis on getting you to Hello World and beyond.</p>

<p>They say Chef has a steep learning curve, but I think that’s only because there are a lot of concepts you need to know before you can do the most basic things. I tried to cover most of those concepts here. I also included some best practices I discovered such as how to handle secrets like passwords and certificates using Chef.

                            <p>Recently, I worked on a sprint as part of our company’s scrum process.  This sprint was somewhat unusual in that I was the sole developer.  Not only that but I knew most of the specs in my head, so our product manager and I agreed it wasn’t necessary to write acceptance criteria for the user stories I would be working on.  Since I wrote the acceptance criteria, it made sense that I would be the one who ultimately signed off on the user stories.</p>

<p>I hate bureaucracy so I was excited about how “lightweight” this process for the sprint was.  But I found something kind of interesting.</p>

<p>When I was wearing my developer hat, I realized how much I enjoyed taking time to learn about other technologies.  I had made a commitment to my teammates to get a certain amount of work done by a certain date, and we came up with estimates to make sure that the work was achievable.</p>

<p>But once I was doing it, my human nature started subconsciously looking for ways to “cheat”.  I still wanted to get the work done, and done well.  I wanted to be acknowledged by my colleagues for having delivered what was expected with high quality.  But I also wanted to sneak in extra time so I could do more tech learning on the side.</p>

                            <p>When it comes to paying a medical bill, I’ve had a backwards experience.  As the founder of <a href="http://omedix.com/">Omedix</a>, I built software that’s collected tens of millions of dollars in healthcare bill payments, but I hardly ever paid any healthcare bills of my own.  I was under 30 and hardly went to the doctor!</p>

<p>Next month I turn 34 and I am fortunate that neither my wife nor I has any chronic medical issues, but now we go to the doctor for the usual annual checkups.  In 2013, our health visits amounted to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Annual well-checks with our primary care physician (PCP)</li>
<li>The lab tests our PCP’s requested</li>
<li>In her case, annual visit with an OB/GYN</li>
<li>In my case, annual check up at the dermatologist (skin doctor)</li>
<li>In my case, annual check up at the ophthalmologist (eye doctor)</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, I’m about 4 hours in and almost done paying all the healthcare bills.  The experience has been…traumatizing.  First, multiple bills are sent for the same service, but with slight differences.  Second, our doctor tried to bill insurance, had the wrong info, sent us a bill for the full amount, was later informed the insurance was wrong, adjusted the bill, and sent an updated one.</p>

<ul>
<li>Non-blocking / Evented vs. Threaded</li>
<li>Command-line interface to compile, test, and more</li>
<li>Clearly inspired by the productivity Ruby on Rails, but written for Java</li>
<li>Written using a Functional Programming paradigm</li>
<li>Super-easy for creating RESTful web services
The devil’s always in the details, of course, but it’s been a blast so far! More to come on Play…

                            <p>I’ve decided to try an experiment lately.  At every opportunity where I see I can possibly add value to someone in some way, I try to do so.</p>

<p>This can mean connecting someone with someone else I know, sharing insights from experiences I’ve had that may be applicable, or even mini-projects that leverage my technical skills.</p>

<p>Like any other behavior change, this is a habit that takes some work to build, so I’m not 100% ramped up yet, but at least the habit is building, so hopefully after a few weeks it will just be my default behavior.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’ve had a few interesting observations about it:</p>

                            <p>I had a very powerful business experience about 4 years ago that taught me a lesson that I didn’t fully understand until recently.</p>

<p>I was the sole owner of a company that received a Letter of Intent from a publicly traded company to be acquired for around $1 million, all before I was even 30 years old. Sure sounds sexy, right?  Well, the catch was that we were not profitable at that time and of course the time between receiving a Letter of Intent and actually signing all the contracts, getting a check in the bank, and considering the acquisition a done deal can be anywhere from a few weeks to over a year.</p>

<p>So we waited. Doing our best to not be too unprofitable and not incur too many legal expenses, but thrilled at the prospect of an acquisition that would instantly remove all the stress. I remember every day trying to act to the outside world like things were fine, but inside I felt incredibly stressed. Each day was a new opportunity to obsess just a little bit more about when the acquisition would finally close.</p>

<p>And then finally it did. Except that it didn’t go through, it <em>fell</em> through.</p>

                            <p>I keep noticing a recurring theme in my hobbies and in business: cut out the noise and focus only on the essential.</p>

<p>It seems so simple, but the fascinating thing about life is that the things and people we encounter so rarely do cut through the noise.  Instead it seems like most endeavors of consequence are messy, complicated and hard, and it’s not always clear why.</p>

<p>When you approach almost everything with the mentality of “how do I cut out the noise?” life becomes a very magical experience where a little effort in the right place can yield big results.</p>

<p>I think can think of at least 3 areas of my own life where cutting out the noise yielded big results.</p>

                            <p>I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pitch-Anything-Innovative-Presenting-Persuading/dp/0071752854">Pitch Anything</a> by Mr. Oren Klaff and one of the coolest concepts in the book was the idea of “frames.”</p>

<p>A frame is basically the set of beliefs, contexts, and assumptions that implicitly sit behind everything you communicate.  The author argues that when two people meet, their frames eventually “clash” and that only one frame can win out.  This concept was also discussed in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pitch-Anything-Innovative-Presenting-Persuading/dp/0071752854">The Game</a> by Neil Strauss, but it was presented there in the context of attracting girls, not clients.</p>

<p>Anyway, after I finished reading Pitch Anything, I have been blessed with a special insight into how I and others think, and to the social dynamics underlying most business transactions.</p>

<p>Take sales, for example.  When I first started out doing sales, my mentality was always about understanding what the client was saying as precisely as possible and, to the greatest extent possible, providing him with exactly what he requested.  But it turns out that’s not the best way to do business.  Often times, I’ve found, people respect when you challenge them because they see it as an opportunity for growth.  I realized one day that with myself, when someone challenges me head-on, I find them really interesting and then start engaging about why they disagree.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Thrashing</strong> n. To expend a disproportionately high amount of energy relative to the quality of output you receive</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was younger and looked at successful companies, I simply could not for the life of me understand how they ever went from NOTHING to what they were today. The modern equivalent would be like asking “How did Jamba Juice launch hundreds of stores across the country? How did that start?” It made sense to me that if you raised a massive amount of money and then immediately bought all the capital equipment and hired all the people you needed then you’d at least be capable of serving all the customers, and that the massive revenue from the customers would balance out your massive expenses…but how did it all come to be from NOTHING? It seemed like magic to me.</p>

<p>And from this line of thought I embarked on what I believe is the fundamental fallacy of entrepreneurial thinking: asking the question “what does a company need to do to succeed?”</p>
